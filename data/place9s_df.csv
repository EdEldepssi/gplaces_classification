I was visiting from Manassas and decided to stop in. Same great for, same great atmosphere. This location has a very good feel to it, with the warning rays of sun setting a good mood coming thru the front doors. The only gripes I could come up with were that the table was a bit dirty, and that the area from the parking lot to the inside has a door but it wasn't the front door....?? This is a apparently a mobile order To-Go door. It really throws off the look of the restaurant when the first door that guests can walk up to isn't the front door... But, I guess there's nothing the restaurant staff or managers can do about that, haha! That's an architect and engineer's thing. Overall the service was great. I ordered the chicken enchilada soup to start (no tortilla strips), and original chicken crispers as a main. They were both cooked well, and perfect. My server continually checked in on me and wasn't the talkative type. He let me say what I needed and left it simple, which I appreciated very much. He brought me a couple things when I asked for them and was always there to help at the right time. What I did find odd was that the person bringing me my food was not the person checking on me or taking my order. All in all, a great ending to the day for me.

Unfortunately, this location doesn't meet the bar Chipotle has set for its customers. I'm not sure when things changed. My workplace is close to this location so prior to COVID, I often ordered from this location. While I worked from home, I ate at the Burke and Woodbridge location, both are consistent with the Chipotle brand I've grown to love. Now, I'm back in the office after two years, and the Kingstowne location is not the same. The staff, mostly the women there, aren't very hospitable. They are impatient and lack customer service skills. I think training in this particular area would be beneficial. And, as crazy as this sounds coming from someone like me who adds salt to my food before I even try it, THE FOOD IS EXTREMELY SALTY.  Someone in the kitchen has a very heavy hand. Two weeks ago, I couldn't finish my burrito after TWO bites. I was literally choking on salt. The salt was so overpowering, I couldn't even taste the food. I didn't complain, though. I chalked it up as a bad day in kitchen. But again today, the food is so salty that I can't enjoy my meal. I'm on the fence about returning my food but twice in a row, I paid for a meal I cannot eat. Honestly, I'm not one for negative reviews. If I really don't like a place or service, I'd rather just not return. However, my hope is that management will see this and work towards correcting these issues. Either way, I'm still a Chipotle fan, just not this particular location."", 'time': 1652722066, 'translated': False}, {'author_name': 'Darren Lee', 'author_url': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109009666644282177799/reviews', 'language': 'en', 'original_language': 'en', 'profile_photo_url': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu-jR1azL3De55zmeLZonbWrBRvs2gbtJv4VGE4fJA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo', 'rating': 1, 'relative_time_description': '2 months ago', 'text': 'This is the worst Chipotle I’ve ever been to. I live 5 minutes away, so I’ve frequented it way more than I’d have liked to. What’s most impressive is their sheer consistency in providing bad service and screwing up orders. The last 5 times in a row I went there they messed multiple things up. They ALWAYS forget drinks for kids meals or give the wrong ones, they serve extremely stale chips, and they have no clue how to roll burritos. I think I’ve had one burrito out of about 10 from them that didn’t just completely fall apart. They’re also terrible at managing mobile orders. They have a whole shelving system with letters for names set up for mobile orders, yet for some unfathomable reason, they keep all of the orders behind the register so you have to wait for 5-10 minutes until they acknowledge you to ask if your food is ready. Most of the time your order won’t be ready even though the “order ready” time has passed. They’ll even set it all out to make, but then just continue making food for the people in line - even though you’re standing right there and already told them you’re there to pick up your order. I don’t think this chipotle has ever gotten one of my orders completely correct. It’s almost like they train their employees to be bad at their jobs. I have to think the only reason this store is still in operation is because of its proximity to so many people and lack of another good option nearby.
