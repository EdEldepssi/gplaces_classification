Fine. Off I go to pick it up.\n\nI show up at the restaurant, which was empty by the way, except for a few people waiting for takeout. Come to find out our order is NOT ready.

The sushi didn\'t taste as fresh as other locations. Something wierd about the taste. The fish did not have the consistency or texture I have tasted previously.\n\nDisclaimer, I don\'t like seafood but for you guys I will taste every food out there.\n\nBeef Bento, beef was over cooked, which made it hard and chewy. The sauce was not salty.\n\nThe dumplings were extremely oily! It was like putting a spoon full of oil in your mouth. First time I\'ve had fried dumplings so oily. See pictures.\n\nThe other fried items, onions, sweat potatoes,etc.. were spot on.  üëå\n\nThe best item was the fried ice cream. Together, the fried coating and vanilla ice cream made sense. All textures matched perfectly. My two cents, maybe ask the client if they may wish some warm chocolate to give the flavors an added dimension. The constant flavors can get boring.  But this dish is definitely the only reason I would return. Go figure.\n\nLOCATION\n\nIt\'s next to a major strip mall, in a small section with plenty of parking.\n\nRESTAURANT\n\nSmall, tight.

This order was a customer pickup done on the Maggiano's website.  I don't even have a Door Dash account.\n\nEven if it was a third party, how on earth would the quality of my meal have anything to do with a delivery service?  I've amended my review from two stars to one.\n\nOriginal review: This was our first order from Maggiano's since before the pandemic.  It was our wedding anniversary and we decided to stay in, splurge a bit and order out from one of our favorite places.\n\nFirstly, after my husband arrived and checked in, he was acknowledged and then ignored for ages.  I called the restaurant to remind them he was outside, and they responded in such a manner that I can only assume he'd been forgotten.\n\nOkay, no big whoop.  Maybe they were super busy.\n\nThen I opened the food.  The fettucine portion was not very large for two people. It was dry and hard and the sauce had seeped down to the bottom of the container in a sad sticky puddle.  I sighed, but tried to make the best of it.  I stirred as best I could, cut the lump in half with a spatula and flipped it upside down so my husband wouldn't see how bad it looked.\n\nThen I opened the salad.  What.the.fudge.  The avocado I paid extra for was so old it had turned black.  Not just brown from being cut and sitting for awhile, black and rotten. (see photos) One of the three cherry tomatoes had a black rotten spot.  The croutons no longer had an iota of crunch - they kind of sadly dissolved when eaten.\n\nOne of the loaves of bread was burned.  (I think some people like it that way, but it should be an option, not a default.) Had to throw it out it was so hard inside and out.\n\nThe cheesecake - pretty darn good.  Large portion, fresh strawberries, sauce and whipped cream.   And my husband liked his chicken parmesan.   Two stars.\n\nOverall, it was $80 worth of mostly garbage.  So much food thrown away!  I didn't feel well at all for two days - likely from the salad I tried to salvage since my husband was fine.  I should've just tossed all of it.\n\nCome on, Maggiano's.
