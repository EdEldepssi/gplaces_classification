The side of honey pepper relish was something different and really good.  Looks like a real, old fashioned diner like the one I knew as a teenager.  Now, I appreciate the ten percent discount for seniors.\n",

      "Text: I had the lemony hummus with cauliflower pita bread and it was delicious. The sweet potato fries are very good too. The serving sizes are smaller than at other restaurants. I definitely felt like I could eat some more after I finished my meal. Also it's a little pricey for the small serving size. The hummus pita dish was around $16 I think. For that amount of money I want a good filling meal that doesn't leave me still feeling hungry. But if you don't want large portion sizes this might be a good restaurant for you.\n",

      "I went at lunch time on a Friday and it was very busy, the parking lot was very full and I had to park far from the restaurant. However there was no line or wait time so that was great. It did take awhile for our food to be prepared. Maybe 20 or 30 minutes. The staff were polite but seemed harried and overwhelmed due to the busyness. They did get our orders correct, so that was good. I wasn't sure with how distracted our waiter was what we'd end up getting. Overall a good experience. My main complaints are the small serving size for the price and I didn't like the crowded, busy atmosphere and the long wait for the food.\n",

I was at a bougie restaurant for brunch in Old Town, and their food and mimosas didn't come close to the quality of this silver diner. I got the tropical mimosa which is guava mint, and it was delicious! I also got the oat protein pancakes, with coconut almond whipped cream. It was a delicious pairing, I just wish the pancakes were cooked a little more in the middle. The staff was also very friendly, and there was no wait because I got to sit at the counter. Highly recommend this place for local brunch\n",

      "\n",
      "Dance prices are also very high. 100 for a 2 song lap dance that didn’t include any contact. Not too sure if that was an actual club rule or me getting ripped off by the dancer. Be very judicious about who you select as a dancer. Some have poor attitudes and expect a free check for no work at all. Originally, the dancer mentioned she doesn’t even do 100 dollar dances like she was above it. At that point, I should’ve caught the red flags and not have given her any business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ended up getting a much better experience from another dancer for 150 for 10 minutes. Plenty of contact, very intimate and very into her dance / routine. If you find a good dancer, get her schedule since they’re all shift workers now and aren’t independent contractors.\n",

It's a classier venue than some of those in the DC area and def than the ones in Bmore. It's one of those places where you can come in and easily find a favorite dancer, favorite bartender and even a favorite floor manager! The ambience is pretty chill and staff is great.\n",

      "I arrived 8:15pm, and the place is closing at 9:30pm. My wife and I ordered simple food: Bertucci's platter as starter ( 4 chicken wings, 2 garlic bread, 2 meatball, 2 grilled cheese), 1 lasagna, and 1 chicken Parmigiano. The garlic bread was not fresh made today, the consistency indicated it was made a day ago as sooner. The lasagna supposed made in a brick oven came totally cold in the center. This issue happened when you change the brick oven by microwave. The waitress was so nice, and that disaster was not her fault. She tried to fix the issue, and offered me a new lasagna whole the clock shows 9:00 pm. I said please don't, but she insisted. Well, there is the picture of the same plate that she brought. I guess the chef put more cheese on top, and place into the brick oven until burn it.\n",

      "\n",
      "We ordered through Grubhub and our order was delayed multiple times. My husband called to check in and they said it would not take as long as Grubhub was estimating and that they were just behind because of their BOGO pizza deal on Tuesdays. BOGO pizza deal? Uhhh well we paid full price through Grubhub. The manager was shocked to learn the discount doesn’t show up for Grubhub customers. First issue. My husband very politely explained how long we’ve been waiting and we were offered a future free pizza. Fine.\n",

      "More delays later our order is randomly cancelled via Grubhub. My husband calls again. They are shocked to learn the order was cancelled… not sure how that works but ok… so they tell him the pizzas just came out of the oven and they will give them to us for free if I want to come get it. Fine. Off I go to pick it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I show up at the restaurant, which was empty by the way, except for a few people waiting for takeout. Come to find out our order is NOT ready. There was no presence from the manager. He came around to put some things into the POS system and never acknowledged any of the weary customers who had been waiting for hours. Never apologized, and never even appeared to have any sense of urgency to get the restaurant back on track.\n",

      "Finally the pizza was done and it was absolutely disgusting. The dough was practically uncooked yet the cheese was burned. We threw it away. After over 3 hours of waiting, we were left hungry.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a pizza restaurant can’t manage to make pizzas- the literal bare minimum- what else isn’t being managed there? Are the employees washing their hands? Makes you wonder. We’re so turned off by the ridiculous wait, poor food quality and lack of management intervention that we will likely not return. It’s very disappointing because we previously loved it. But this experience was beyond ridiculous.\n",

      "Unfortunately, if you want to eat inside, just know that you will come out smelling like smoke. They allow smoking in the pool hall in the back, and although it is on a separate ventilation system, it does not keep the smell of smoke out of the restaurant side. It's not faint either, you will smell it the whole time you eat and your clothes will smell of it afterwards. I am sure it must work out for them to have one of the few places left where people can smoke indoors in the area, but if you are sensitive to it, plan on getting your food to go, or try the outdoor tables.\n",

As I cut the tough steak in front of the manager she denied everything she saw (cooked well well done/ tough to cut). She seemed very rude towards me her attitude was not friendly, she never apologized and I had already waited longer than those who'd come in after me for food, so I didn't order a new steak. Her response completely turned me off. I've had a porterhouse cooked medium well here before and it was delicious, nothing like my experience today. Needless to say I sent the meal back and they took it off my ticket. My children enjoyed their chicken tenders and fries.\n",

The rib eye had burnt tips and was flavorless. On top of that, so was the au jus...flavorless. How can au jus be flavorless. Everything else I had tasted wonderful.

Not messy and untidy, literally dirty.

Service was also prompt and the food was being refilled soon as it was half empty. Maybe because of the weekend. We have a good experience. There were a few soup options and Pho and grilled food options. There was sushi as well. The restroom and the restaurant was clean. There was also ice cream.\n",

Back to the restaurant,  it is very nicely decorated and the people working here were friendly and efficient. The food was excellent, tasty and filling, very close to authentic Tex Mex. Good for the Washington area. As another reviewer stated, there were a lot of Hispanics here, so they know what they like. Good margaritas, too. If you like Mexican food,  go to El Paso.\n",

If Hispanic families patronize a Mexican restaurant I feel like they would be a good judge. Not racist just obvious. Just like a New York Italian restaurant filled with Italian families. THAT'S the Italian restaurant I want to go to. I feel like we're still allowed to have ethnicity and food comparisons and in fact family run ethnic business are extremely proud of the ethnic food they prepare and serve. This place is a wonderful example of great Mexican food in a great Mexican restaurant atmosphere. Everything was great from start to finish. Shrimp was huge! Refried beans and cheese were amazing. The drinks were great. The portions were so good. Don't leave Springfield without a trip to El Paso.\n",

I decided to wait and see if he would follow customer service etiquette and put the phone away, he only did so after after I appeared to walk near to look at the menu. As I began to order, the associate then grabbed gloves with his dirty hands that were just using the cell phone. I then proceeded to ask him to wash his hands and he simply ran water on his hands for 5 seconds and put the same contaminated gloves on. I walked out of the store at this point. Management, please retrain your staff to follow proper hand washing procedures and the importance of reducing the risk of communicable diseases due to poor sanitation practices.

The quality and availability of food items is far above other neighboring Subways as is the service, cleanliness of the location and team members actually add veggies to fill the sandwich instead of the others who count the lettuce strands, pickles and tomato slices such that the sandwich looks anorexic. Not here. The only word of warning is that this location is near a Chick-fil-A that has a VERY faithful following where it can be difficult to get in and out of the shopping center, even if you park on the opposite end from Subway.\n",

Take the extra time and go somewhere else. I did a mobile order and order two brown sugar cream cold brews and two sweet black pepper bacon sandwiches and arrived with my coffee made but sandwiches not even started because the women didn't even look to see that there was more to the order. Then they had none of the bagels we ordered and every other type of bread they had was hard, per them telling us, besides an English muffin. After walking out to the car and trying my coffee THEY DIDNT EVEN PUT THE BROWN SUGAR SYRUP IN THE COFFEE! So I had to walk back in AGAIN to get the syrup in the coffee.  And on top of that there were only two people working and the older lady was too busy taking to her husband, as she kept saying, to provide any customer service let alone to even do her job and make or help with orders. Definitely wouldn't recommend going to this specific store.\n",

The Chicken Alfredo was also super delicious, although not quite sure how I felt about the tomato slices in the pasta. That was certainly different. Otherwise great place to get some good food.\n",

The restaurant is small and simple inside with some Italian themed decorations on the walls and big stacks of pizza to-go boxes ready to be put to use. Service by wait staff is very professional and experienced. Lots of folks stopping by to get their food takeout orders also. Very tasty food!\n",

All I can say is if u are one of those people who order online, like through Express entree, do not expect your order on time, if they are busy at the restaurant they will leave those online orders to the very end, I was there 2 days ago and they kept me waiting for ONE HOUR after the estimated pick up time, the Hispanic manager definitely can't perform that job properly, after that hour they didn't even have my food, the order was cancelled after they wasted my time. smfh\n",

They then inform me they can't make hot drinks but couldn't be bothered to announce it to those waiting for hot drinks??  Said they could make cold versions, waited another 10 minutes for them to not make those as well.  Complained again finally got donuts and 1 of my drinks in cold version.  30 minutes later I'm out of time to waste, have cold food and a missing drink.  Had to leave in frustration.

Yesterday, we went to this branch and the lady who took my order acted like she hated her job. No greeting, she was rushing us to say our order, and didn't even apologize when she got our order wrong. Then this other lady who was organizing the donuts literally touched the donuts with her bare hands. My husband called her out on it and she replied with \"no, I was touching the tray\" ummm no, you were not lady. It's very unsanitary and when I went to get my drinks on the other side of the counter, I happen to just take a peek of the kitchen and it is just filthy. Please, do something about this.\n",

Recently, we visited and noticed that there was only one waitress on duty name Crissy and there were quite a bit of customers in the restaurant.  She appeared to be overwhelmed but pushed through it and did a magnificent job. Although my Sunshine Skillet was horrible, the Cook really tried to keep up and did a better job with the Pancakes.

Of course I didn't realize this until after I arrived home (I live in Lorton) so I decided to consider it a loss and never visit this establishment again! I honestly didn't even feel it was worth calling and complaining because what I received was no accident it was done purposely to cut corners. This review is to forewarn others before you make the mistake of ordering food here or to at least ask to see your food before you leave. I never order just plain breadsticks so it took me a while to realize all the seasonings consisted of the same seasonings which top breadsticks. It was a pathetic way to mask deception. As a business if you're low on an ingredient don't offer dishes which require said ingredient.\n",

The food is, well, fast food, and as such does not disappoint. Unlike other locations, however, this place seems to have dedicated itself to a strict policy of anti-customer service. The lack of courtesy appears to be the only constant. I've been a regular since I started a new job eight months ago, and in that time, I have received a correct order exactly once. My suggestion, if you're passing through, drive to the next location; that is, if you truly want your meal your way.\n",

      "Text: I had the most awful Burger King experience here today! I ordered through the mobile app to take advantage of my account’s coupon online while at the drive through window. I spoke with the assistant over the kiosk and expressed to them that my order would be coming through momentarily but that I didn’t want onions on my burger. I stated that I didn’t see the option online but still placed it through the app to mobile pay. The assistant, Paula immediately said “your order is already done”. I had just ordered 20 seconds ago while at the window, as mentioned earlier. I asked her was it possible to have no onions and she responded rudely “no you ordered through the app”. I continued to question why the order couldn’t be remade since I had just placed it and she replied that they don’t remake orders and she refused to assist any further. Which more than likely means, they already had extra burgers ready and didn’t “feel” like making any more. I asked her whether orders were made to order or preprepared and she responded that they make them as they receive them. How was a burger made in 20 secs? I pulled up to the receiving window and she was extremely rude and said that if I had an issue, I needed to reorder through the app and her body language was extremely aggressive. Due to her hostile manner, I asked to speak to the manager, Mr. Lopez who approached me with the same rude tone and responded that they don’t remake orders and that there was nothing he would do. In such disbelief, I called customer service who immediately assisted with my order and refunded me. They were extremely pleasant and kind. They advised me that they would assist with me re-ordering but I was apprehensive because I didn’t know if they would tamper with my food. I have never had such a negative experience before at any restaurant and was shocked that Burger King would have staff members who don’t take customer service and politeness to all seriously. I wish they had been more kind and willing to work with their customer. I will never come back to this location.\n",

      "Text: They dumped more than half of the plate with Lettuce and tomatoes without asking me and then One spoon rice and half spoon chicken, I asked for double protein which $2.99 extra they still put a half spoon. So the total is almost $16. This is a lot of money for what I got. I’m not here for Lettuce. The next door Giant has a big bag of lettuce for $1  i guess I will go there for lettuce if I needed, not halal guys which charge $16. I won’t come again here, here’s a lot of more restaurants you can buy decent meal for $10. Judge my review by the picture. Would you pay $16 for this?\n",

I'm NOT stupid to not know the difference between both kinds of meat. The girl asked me to send her a photo and then called me back saying that she can tell from the spices on the meat that it's lamb. It's beef sold as lamb, and it's a poor quality beef too.\n",

      "I don’t know what is going on there, but the meal we had that Sunday was terrible. The meat wasn’t good, the falafel were shaped into discs instead of balls, the bread was flat, and the yogurt sauce had the consistency of water. As someone else mentioned, it seemed like the bread and falafel were store-bought. Plus, they always included some rice in combos, even if bread or salad was chosen. We ordered combos based on that prior knowledge and chose bread. That prior assumption was proven wrong and there was no rice in our combo. All that said, I don’t plan to return for a good while… I was honestly blown away by how bad the food was, considering Moby Dick’s was consistent every single time before.\n",

Although the text/call never came through, we walked up from the bar area to check in. The bar area is very loud but is also an option to grab drinks/food. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. We ordered the firecracker shrimp as an app and the ginger flavor was the perfect amount. The rolls are a must try, they're also only $1, almost like a donut texture/taste. We got the fried chicken salad and salmon salad both were absolutely delicious.

Cheesesteaks all slap, but the cold cuts are freshly shaved in the store—which seems to give some extra freshness to it. Veggies always taste like they were just cut too. They have the bread to meat to veg ratio on these are down to a science. 4.6 star for a chain store sandwich.\n",

      "The food I had at Karahi Kabab was delicious. I have not had such great kabobs in the DC for a long time. The meat was perfectly cooked, nicely charred yet still juicy. The chickpeas were extremely creamy and did not have any excess oil. The Naans were unlike anywhere else, nicely baked with a tasty ghee and sesame topping. The seasoning and salt levels of all the food was on point. Everything was served at the same time and came piping hot. But make sure to come with patience as they make everything to order and become very busy with takeout orders. Regardless, the service here was great and they were very friendly and apologetic about the wait time. But in the end, the food was definitely worth the wait.\n",

      "Text: Couple things, they do not sell ALOT of Bolivian food which kinda sucks for a Bolivian restaurant. the charque SOMETIMES it’s served with real FRESCO cheese other times it’s not so I suggest asking before you order if they have fresh queso or the pre bought queso. The menú so tiny ! there entrees Monday - Friday only 5 - 7 items on the whole menu. Of those items I ordered Charque not available today ? Okay the falso conejo they didn’t have that either. :/ the pasteles are stale and have almost no cheese.. I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt and I came for a bit but the last two times I’ve come it has not been it..\n",

You didn't have to get up to serve yourself your food, they brought you water to the table, cleaned up after you ate and put up with your grumpy faces.  The least you can do is leave a good tip to the person who gave you their service.  IF YOU HAVE SO MUCH COMPLAINT, EAT AT HOME AND DON'T RUIN THE LIFE OF THE PERSON WHO GIVES YOU THE SERVICE!!!!\n",

Api is watered down and Pasteles have little to no cheese.  Meats, such as the Charque, are dry and chewy.  Others are too salty.   Salteñas aren't close to Bolivian salteñas.\n",

Chuy's serve the food where the two guest can add how much rice, beans, salad and proteins into each individual plate. I found that very interesting as that's never occurred to me before.

I love their burgers. If you like pork burger then go with Kurobuta. If you like beef then go with pepper jack. Make sure to add truffle fries as a side which is worth it. If you want appetizer then I would go with chicken lettuce wraps because the meat is so soft and you feel a bit healthier wrapping them around with lettuce. Feels fresh too. Alcohol selection is phenomenal so you don't have to worry about that at all. So, enjoy here by trying them out. You can walk around the mall to digest afterwards and shop as well =)\n",

Recommend getting reservations before you show up especially on weekends before dinner as they can get busy and seem to have less staff than tables. I ordered the Steak Medallions which were cooked perfectly but I thought the sauce was just ok and I asked for a vegetable instead of the mashed potatoes but still got the potatoes. They were good about fixing the problem and brought out my vegetables. The restaurant tends to have large groups and there is not great dividers to buffer the sound so it gets really loud depending on who is sitting near you. Overall a good restaurant, pricey, but still very enjoyable.\n",

Ordered a half lemon herb chicken with two sides (roasted cauliflower and Brussel sprouts) and a custard tart. The restrained portion sizes and prices were welcome as were the milder flavors from South African inspired food like these offerings. The chicken was cooked well and not too dry or over seasoned. The cauliflower had a turmeric look and proved satisfying as did the brussel sprouts. The custard tart was small (with a price to match) and helped me not overindulge with this straightforward palate cleanser. Overall I thought I received a decent value for the meal and a guiltless feeling for the rest of my night. I could eat this food again.\n",

My order consisted of the chicken breast wrap, fries, corn, and a cheesecake. The wrap was 95% greens and 5% chicken. After one bite of the 2nd half of my wrap, there was no chicken left. I could not even taste the chili jam. The fries are now delivered in a bag and the fries were soggy and broken. The butt of the corn seemed spoiled and brown, so I cut off (see photos). My cheesecake was good, so there's that.  Overall,  it was just not a good experience.\n",

When bitten into it tasted like coal. The servers were nice, but the food came out at weird times, and it took an hour to get a fountain drink. The whole kitchen system was unorganized and messy. The steak was also cooked very weirdly, it seemed like they just put the steak in the oven and briefly put it on the grill. Also half the games weren't working and it was very understaffed.\n",

Our waitress Helen was phenomenal, she was engaging,  a beautiful young lady with an amazing spirit; I must say that the staff was top notch. There were five in our party,  we ordered appetizers, which came out in a timely manner and the temperature and flavors were perfect, then we ordered a variety of entrees; I had the salmon with Jasmin rice,  and green beans with a creole butter sauce; I was totally blown away.  The salmon was cooked to perfection,  the sides including the rice were delicious,  as the kids say that meal was bussing. I cannot say enough about my visit, it was unexpectedly fantastic!!\n",

Apparently he stated that his position is that he can’t open certain things to make an ice tea? We ask for a tall drink and gave us a large straw also stating that it’s the only one they have despite the time we went was in the MORNING!! How can they run out if we came around 10 am?! Oh and the guy didn’t have a receipt too. As we were drinking our beverages from one of those tables, we noticed how he acted  sarcastic and rudely towards the customers. My brother actually worked in Starbucks before and stayed none of the employees never had this kind of attitude. If he doesn’t like his job then he should leave, he definitely ruin our morning that day. I never had an experience with any kind of Starbucks where they run out of a lot of ingredients for a drink.

They’re always out of something that I ask or whether it’s a Venti cup or vanilla or almond milk. Associates are so slow they usually only have one person working so you really stand in line for at least 10 minutes each time. Today I had a terrible experience I simply ordered a Venti iced coffee I don’t have the tea cups I got the next size down a grilled cheese and a pumpkin muffin he informed me that they’re out of pumpkin muffins and asked if I would like something else or if I would like a refund on the month and I told him I just give me something else but I’m doing that he informed me that the whole order had to be refunded and he had to re-ring me up the grill cheese and iced coffee problem is I used a card I already paid so in essence I would be paying twice for this transaction until the week it takes for the money to come back on my card. I don’t care if I spend 10 hours in the small I’m not used to the Starbucks again. Target might as well make them work for tips so they put effort in ended up buying a bottles Starbucks drink from target\n",

Great Steak is an example of a restaurant that sautees then adds the veggies to the sandwich - MUCH better option for me.

But you still play the same amount as you would with if you got your bowl with the add ons. I know it’s normal for them to run out- but it really sucked when I was craving for what I wanted…\n",

It's not crazy good that you would travel hundreds of kilometers but it's good. And it's not very expensive either. Try their homey golden shrimps that cost $1.25 extra but they were good.

I think because of the boxes - if they used plates I think the portions would be larger.  Feel like I spent too much for too little shrimp and chicken and too much noodles.

Very pricey, however. 20 dollar cover, 10 dollars for a non alcoholic drink. 12 percent charge to use atm and 24 percent fee on credit card use.\\n\\nDance prices are also very high. 100 for a 2 song lap dance that didn’t include any contact. Not too sure if that was an actual club rule or me getting ripped off by the dancer. Be very judicious about who you select as a dancer. Some have poor attitudes and expect a free check for no work at all. Originally, the dancer mentioned she doesn’t even do 100 dollar dances like she was above it. At that point, I should’ve caught the red flags and not have given her any business.\\n\\nEnded up getting a much better experience from another dancer for 150 for 10 minutes. Plenty of contact, very intimate and very into her dance / routine. If you find a good dancer, get her schedule since they’re all shift workers now and aren’t independent contractors.',\n",
